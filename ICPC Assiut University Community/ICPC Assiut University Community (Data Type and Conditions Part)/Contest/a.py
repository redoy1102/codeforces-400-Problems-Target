originalPrice = p / (1-(x/100))

print("%.2f" % originalPrice)


# To calculate the original price before the 20% discount, you can use the following formula:

# Original price = discounted price / (1 - discount rate)

# In this case, the discounted price is 80 taka and the discount rate is 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

# Original price = 80 / (1 - 0.2)
# Original price = 80 / 0.8
# Original price = 100 taka

# Therefore, the original price before the 20% discount was 100 taka.
